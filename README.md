## Description
The above code comprises of a (soon to be) fully functional Android app, built using React, tailwind CSS and firebase for the backend. 

One of the main focuses of this project was to make three essential profiles:
- Administrators: They have the authority to manage all services, branch profiles, and customer accounts, ensuring that everything runs smoothly.
- Employees: Responsible for creating and managing their profiles, handling service requests, and inputting their working hours to serve customers efficiently.
- Customers: They can easily search for branches, fill out necessary forms, and submit their service requests with just a few clicks.

We chose React for its efficient component-based architecture, TailwindCSS for its flexible, utility-first styling, and Firebase for its seamless real-time data syncing and authentication.
